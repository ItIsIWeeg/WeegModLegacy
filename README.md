# Kade Engine Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, and your grade/rating.
 - **Better key layouts**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, now you can play with any keybind!

# Weeg Mod Features

 - **Heavy Optimization**
	 - Say goodbye to (most) of those lag spikes! Most of the base game (and Kade Engine)'s code has been optimized for running smoother on literal toasters. Who woulda thought.
 - **Character Select Screen**
	 - Play as any character in the game, simple as that! You may come across new opponents along the way, too...
 - **Sound Test**
	 - Check out every song in the game! You can also single out the instrumental or the vocals, and even set an instrumental as the menu music!
 - **Character Dependent Note Colors**
	 - What it says on the tin. That's cool, right?
