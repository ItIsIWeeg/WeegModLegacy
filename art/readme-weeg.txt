HEY YOU!

Thanks for downloading the Weeg Mod, means a lot to me :)

How's about I go around with some info:

PERMISSIONS
-----------

Yes, you can stream, makes videos on, or do anything like that with Weeg Mod.

Fan art is also acceptible, if not encouraged! It means to me people like my silly little additions! However, NSFW of any of *my* characters (Macy and Kazuki) is strictly FORBIDDEN, because I am a minor and I don't want that stuff of my characters.

Coding wise, yeah, feel free to use bits and pieces of this code! It's up on github, not when I'm writing this but I'm sure the GameBanana page has it linked or something.
