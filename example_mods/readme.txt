As of 2.0, THIS IS THE MOD FOLDER! WOO!

Ok so here's how this baby works:

so, you got a chart right? pretty swag. drop that shit in that "songs" folder there. yeah. same with the music. you're gonna want to have 5 files in each folder:
- song.json
- song-easy.json
- song-hard.json
- Inst.ogg
- Voices.ogg

obviously replace "song" with the folder name (like if the folder name's "zavodila", make the json files "zavodila.json", "zavodila-easy.json" and "zavodila-hard.json". 

NOTE: if you're using a song that typically goes over another song (ex. B-Sides), you need to edit the "song" variable in each difficulty's json to match the folder's name. Otherwise the game will crash.

NOW. you're going to want to edit songlist.txt in that folder. Add your song folder's name along with *the character you want to be the opponent.* So if I wanted Pico to be the opponent for Zavodila I'd put down "zavodila:pico" JUST LIKE THAT. Don't worry if you mess up, if you do dad'll just step in. Now if you've done everything correctly that should have put the song into the freeplay menu. CONGRATS, YOU ADDED A SONG! Have fun breaking your fingers to Ballistic or Hellclown or something, idfk. Oh yeah right arrow gimmicks (Tricky's fire arrows, Shaggy's 6 and later 9 lane arrows) DON'T WORK AT THE MOMENT. Also MFM charts have a lot of double notes for some reason so watch out for those.

Oh wait I forgot to mention the CHARACTERS FOLDER

WOOOO

Yeah so you can also put in custom characters. ONLY AS SKINS THOUGH BECAUSE I'M AN IDIOT AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO UTILIZE JSON FILES LIKE AN *IDIOT*

yeah i'll write this part when i impliment them because i havent actually done that yet lol.

If I had to guess how future me will do it, drop your skins into their corresponding character folders and add them to the text file custom characters are listed in or something.
