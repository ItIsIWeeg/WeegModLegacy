:bf:Baboopbeep!!
:dad:I've been looking for you for a while.
:dad:I couldn't help but notice you singing with Mackenzie after I dropped her off here.
:dad:Which is why I want to ask for a favor from you.
:bf:Beep?
:dad:Would you like to "have a go" with me? I composed a song for her, and I'd like to see if you like it.
:bf:Beep!
